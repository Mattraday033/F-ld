He's dead. It's all I could think about while we were waiting and now it's come to pass.

    +I'm sorry. It had to be this way.
        You are wrong, I know it did not have to be so. But I failed in convincing you of that. Something I will regret for the rest of my life.

You killed him! Why? He already gave you the key!

        Leave me. I... I need to be alone.

        \*Janos grits his teeth and eyes you with malice.* Of all the times I have questioned why someone would force us to work ourselves to death, I have never found an answer. In a few short moments, you have managed to reveal to me that its to pen creatures like you! *Janos begins to weep.*

No... AndrÃ¡s.

        Yes, I saw it. Go tell Kastor you have the key. I will stay here and make sure no one finds him- his body.
