				       I was born amongst the nobility.
	The Manse in which I was born has too many rooms to recall. But I can remember running through them, the little hellion that I was. How I revelled in making the servants chase me, and how I smirked when my parents chided them. Life was simple back then.
	What pride we took in our status. I can remember my parents beaming as I recited the family lineage, 14 generations back, all the way to Mesteri, third child of Csaba, first and last king of the Lovashi. It has been over a century since one of my direct line held the title of Count, but nevertheless, the blood is strong in our veins.
	No doubt my family would look down on me now. A relation of theirs, branded? Better that I was dead. But I shall not be so easily forgotten. My blood can not be extinquished by this brand and neither can I. My deeds hence forth shall be the founding chapters in a dynasty that shall eclipse their own.
