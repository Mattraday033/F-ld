				          My parents lived as Hermits.
	Shunning the streets of the Stolen Cities, my parents were people of the wilds. They spent their time eeking a living from the land, tending their garden and hunting when they could. I still remember the hut they built; the fireplace where they dried herbs, the cots they had constructed from stripped bark and branches.
	They taught me the important things in life. That families are precious and fragile. That all people only look out for themselves. That trust has to be earned, and you should not grant it cheaply. I never truly knew how right they were until recently.
	There is a confidence that can be derived from self sufficiency. From a young age I knew I would never starve so long as I had my wits. Nature helps those who help themselves, and the God's only know how many times I have helped myself.
