				   My parents worked as Artisans.
	The backbone of the Lovashi Confederation, the Artisan class makes up the middle rung of the social ladder. Beholden to their noble patrons but lifted above their unskilled peers, the Artisans enjoy some small amount of luxury.
	I remember my parents as hardworking folk. From a young age they taught me to take pride in my craft, whether I worked with tongs or a brush. Never was I idle, even in my younger years, but never did I go hungry either. Competence, reliability, work-ethic; these were the traits they took pains to instill in me.
	Only as I look back on my youth do I realize they approached raising me as they did all of their commissions. They were straightforward like that, but at least I know they put their all into raising me. How it would turn their stomachs to see me now.
