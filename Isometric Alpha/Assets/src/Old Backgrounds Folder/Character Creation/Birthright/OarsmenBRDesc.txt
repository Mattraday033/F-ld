				   My parents worked as Oarsmen.
	The counties that make up the Lovashi Confederation are interlaced with a weave of rivers, which facilitate the Oarsman's profession. Barges travel these waterways, taking people and goods far and wide. My parents met on one of these barges, and as one thing led to another, I came along soon after. 
	They settled for a small time, until I was old enough to be useful aboard a boat, and then they set off again. I've traveled the width and breadth of the Confederation, walked within each of the Stolen Cities, haggled with the Riding Folk of the High Steppes and swindled the Craft Folk of Hatar, all before my fifteenth cycle.
	I think, more than anything, the sedentary nature of my new life is what I dread the most. I am twice caged, barred both from walking the world and floating upon it's rivers. But one day, I will ride them again, and woe betide they that keep me.
