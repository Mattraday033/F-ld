    A week or so after my arrival at this camp, myself and a few other branded snuck into the mess hall and stole some extra rations for ourselves. It was a foolish thing to do, but my life before my branding had ill-prepared me for the meager portions we are provided. The hunger in those first days was the hardest.

    Once the theft was discovered, all of the thieves were quickly apprehended. One of our number, Sampson, chose to give the rest of us up in exchange for special treatment. When the punishments were being handed down, AndrÃ¡s spoke up on my behalf. I was given half the lashes my compatriots received. 

    While I was recovering, he visited me. The care he showed me then, and since, has revealed to me he has a sensitive soul. That is how I know he will help us.

    +He only spoke on your behalf? Did he not speak up for the other branded?

I believe the plan to persuade AndrÃ¡s to give us the key is still sound. But I now know what to discuss with him afterwards. I think I now have the courage to ask the questions I should have already asked.

    Intentions? What do you mean?

        +A relationship between one of the guards and a prisoner is the definition of untoward. I want to know your motives behind initiating it.
            ->9ba

=== 9ba ===

Of course. I understand. I initiated it because of a great loneliness I have felt since my arrival at this camp. We are far from home here, and have orders to never leave the camp. Before I met Janos, I was restless and without a true companion.

Then Janos was brought before Chief Tabor for stealing rations. I lied on his behalf and had his sentence lightened. And while he recovered, I met with him and admitted the truth: that when I first saw him, I knew he stole not because he was wicked, but because he was hungry, and he had my sympathy.

In the time since, I have grown to respect him and his morals. He is the reason why I agreed to fight with you. Had he not been the kind of man he is, I would not have learned the kind of man I had become serving as a guard.


//I fancied him. And I have since I noticed him when he first arrived here, but I did not know how to approach him. Then he was brought before Chief Tabor for stealing rations. I lied on his behalf and had his sentence lightened: not because it was the right thing to do, but because my mind's abacus told me it would ingratiate myself to him.

//I then used a favor I had with one of the Overseers and had Jan given extra recovery time so that I could meet with him in private. While he recovered, we got to talking, and I began to find not just his looks, but his wit to be quite charming as well. 

//In the beginning, I expected this to be no more than a quick fling. The branded do not live long; I had hardened my heart to that a long time ago. But as I came to enjoy my time with Jan more and more, I began to lament that fact. I have said in his presence many times that I wished he could be free. That you all could be. 

//Think me a monster if you wish; I am sickened by the man I was but a few months earlier. But know that my feelings for Jan are real, and that I would no more harm him now than anyone who cares for another. And to lend my words weight, I will lie to my superiors again to keep you all safe, and raise my sword for your cause when the time comes.

    +Love can be a teacher, but it can also be ruinous. Should Janos fall, or renounce his affection, will you still support our cause?
        Janos has not taught me that he alone should be free, but that all branded should be. My support for your cause is unwavering.
        ->9bb
    +Your status as a guard puts you in a dominant position. Will your feelings survive becoming equals?
        ->9bca
    +In as compromising a place as Janos's, how can I trust his safety is assured? Or your intentions are as you say?

My intentions are pure. I have not harmed him and I never will.

    +You protest too hastily. Just because you agree with us in principle does not mean you will keep to your morals when angry, or frightened. Have you thought about what it would take unlearn your training as a guard?

\*AndrÃ¡s looks back at Janos. He thinks for moment, then turns back to you.* I will do it. My people created the brand to serve as a symbol of oppression; to mark a person without a future. Let ours instead symbolize our devotion to one another, and the future of our love.
