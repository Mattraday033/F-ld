I was one of the few people in my village who had experience traveling, so I was instructed to journey to the villages we believed still had some food and ask them for whatever they could spare. I took my cousin, Vidor, with me for safety.","\n","^We traveled to a few villages, but no one had much. One night, as we went to beg for space to stay at a local inn, we saw the tax collector who had taken our levy. I wish I could say I was drunk, or overcome with emotion, but my blood was cold as icewater as I walked up to him. I struck him across the back of the head with my walking staff, and I kept hitting him, even after he had stopped moving. I think it was the sight of him buying an ale that set me off. In my mind, the coin he spent had come from my own village.","\n","^After I had realized the gravity of what I had done, I fled. I took Vidor with me into the woods; my cousin and I hid there for days. We lived off grubs and moss, having little luck with snaring rabbits or fishing. Eventually, Vidor wished to return to the village, but I was too paralyzed with fear to go back. We argued. Finally, he said he would leave with or without me. That's when my fear got the better of me. I shoved Vidor to the ground, then sat atop him while I strangled him. His bulging eyes cursed me the entire time, but in the end he relented, and so did I.","\n","^I had killed my cousin to keep him from revealing where I hid, but it didn't matter in the end. Someone from the inn had summoned the count's men, who were combing the woods looking for me. Only a few hours after I had killed Vidor, they found me drinking at a stream. They chased me with hounds and horses, and I didn't get far. After they caught me, I was quickly branded and sent to this camp.","\n","^During my time here, I constantly thought about what I did. I hated myself for my weakness in allowing my hatred to get the better of me. I loathed how I let my family down by failing to gather the food they were counting on me for. And worst of all, I had slain my own kin at the mere worry he would betray me. These feelings festered, until I couldn't take it anymore. In those moments, I wanted to die.","\n","^Now that it's over, I don't mind telling you this. The plan to escape? When I created it, I didn't think it would succeed. I thought that my friends and I would die fighting the guards. And I was ready for that. Wanted it. It wasn't until Márcos saved Carter and I in the tunnel that I even considered wanting to keep on living. Watching Márcos almost die for us, watching him disobey his Overseer, seeing that he considered us worth saving despite our crimes, made me think that maybe my life was worth saving too.","\n","^When we were stuck in the mine together, Márcos asked me if I could forgive him for what he had done. Before I answered, I told him my tale and asked him if there was forgiveness enough in the world for me too. He said if there could be for him, then there certainly was for me. And that thought got me through everything that came after. I want to live long enough to find out if that kind of forgiveness exists.","\n",["ev",{"VAR?":"letNandorDecideGuardPunishments"},"/ev",{"->":".^.b","c":true},{"b":["\n","^Why can't I bring myself to judge another?
