I found a shiny lump of something while digging in the mine. I'm not sure but I think it's a bit of iron. More valuable than copper or tin, much more. I just can't find where I left it, or I'd be rich.

    +Iron? Is it really worth that much?
        
        I hear iron sells for quite a bit. There aren't many places on FÃ¶ld where it can be mined, so it's coveted by counts and kings alike. It's also harder to work than bronze. I'm no smith so I can't speak to why, but I heard before my branding that it takes a special furnace or some such equipment to melt it down, so you need special know-how to shape it. 
        
        keepDialogue()
        All in all this makes tradin' in iron goods very lucrative, and I had my own little slice of it before I lost it in these blasted crates! 
        ->1e
    +Can't you just wait until the mine opens again and then pocket some more?
        keepDialogue()
        No that's not... You're new so I suppose you wouldn't know, but we don't really mine much ore here, let alone iron ore! We mostly just pull rubble out of the mine, but lately we started finding stuff down there. Furniture, stairs cut into the rock, entire rooms that look like they haven't been lived-in in ages. You wouldn't find any iron unless you get lucky like I did.
        ->1e
    +What use are valuables to a slave? You don't have anywhere to sell them.
        I saw the cook in the mess hall tradin' extra food to slaves who bring him things. Maybe he'd buy it. *Uros absentmindedly scratches his brand.* Besides, it's not like I plan to be a slave forever.

I believe it, you're clearly behind on your tasks. Wait for your lashing outside. If you're not there when I come looking for you, it'll be to the pit with you.

Thank you for bringing this to my attention. If you happen to find whatever he had squirrelled away in here before I get him to talk, and bring it to me, I'll reward you. Just don't let it get in the way of your work; I won't be defending you to some other guard if they come looking for you.
