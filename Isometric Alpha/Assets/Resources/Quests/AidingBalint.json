The guards never speak of our whereabouts or leave the camp, so none of the slaves know where we are. I need to find Bálint in the hut just to the north of the camp's gate, in the center of camp, and assist him in learning our location."},

He wants me to gather some leaves that have blown over the camp's northen wall and return to him with them. I'm not sure if he'll be able to learn anything from it, but Kastor described him as a sage of some kind so maybe he knows something I don't."},

It seems that this camp rests outside the Confederation's borders, south of the Waking Mountains in the Kingdom of Masons. I must tell Kastor so he can adjust our plans accordingly."},
